The spin boxes are used to control the mass, radius, and position of the gravitational potential

Mass 1 changes the mass by a factor of 1 while exponent of mass 1 changes it by a factor of 10.
Same goes for Mass 2.

Radius 1 is connected to mass 1 
P1 x and P1 y are the position of the first mass and it moves it away from the origin

Camera 1 changes the perspective by changing the angle either going closer to the plane or away from it while Camera 2 moves on the z axis orthogonal to camera 1.
